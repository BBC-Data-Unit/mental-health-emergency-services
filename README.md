In October 2019 **Sarah Robertson and Rob England** [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-49910746) that more emergency service staff were taking sick leave due to poor mental health, according to figures for 57 fire, police and ambulance services in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, obtained through a Freedom of Information request which showed:

* More than 5,000 police officers, serving with 29 out of the UK's 48 forces, took time off sick for mental health reasons during 2018-19, compared with just over 4,300 in 2014-15.
* This was 586 fewer officers taking time off in 2018-19 than the year before, however for 16 of the 29 forces it was the highest number over the five-year period.
* Just over 2,700 ambulance staff took time off at nine of the UK's 15 services in 2018-19, compared with just under 1,700 five years earlier.
* There were 837 firefighters who took time off for mental health reasons at 19 out of the 49 services in the UK, compared with 608 in 2014-15.
